# CluelessDevOps
CluelessDevOpsstuff
This is how I am doing the DevOps class homework. Starting from totally Dunno Clueless mode, yet again.
First off, to get hands on familiarity with GitHub. Then only go and do the clone lah, commit lah, deploy lah, trigger lah, Actions lah dunno wat shit.
So I started off by learning how to branch off the main.
  I created a branch (clone the main), named it (whatever lah) and made changes to it (commit, is like... save my changes)
I then made a Pull request, which is say hey main, there are some changes I made in this file that I want the main file to now update itself with.
  (I got to do this, cos you know, I dont just DO IT ONE TIME at the main file, but dua kerja, DO TWO TIMES, do at branch then add in Pull request action)
  In the Pull request, I ask to compare my branch with the main branch.
Then I, myself, who made the changes, and requested a pull request to myself, then went to accept the changes that I myself made to my own file to be updated in the main.
  I did this using the Merge process.

So, basically, from my own file, I have a main and from the main, branches can be made where changes made to branches are not updated to main or destroying the main. Branches drop off and die also nevermind, main one still okay. Once the branches, test, deploy all okay, then can make pull request to merge with main. AND WHO APPROVES the pull requests? ME! Siapa raja? ME! Siapa lembu? Kita juga orangnya.
